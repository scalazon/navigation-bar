# Hackmazon: Navigation Bar microservice
#### FEC project from Prestige Worldwide Development

## High-Level Objective
To create a full-stack clone of a popular e-commerce website's product detail page (in our case, [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com) using React and Express.
Basic functionality needed to include the ability to re-render the displayed product and associated information using search and/or links.

The second primary objective of this Front End Capstone was to use Service-Oriented Architecture, so each piece of the site was built indepdently
by a different team member.
